# digitre

**`Digitre`** is a machine learning application to recognize handwritten digits. **`Digitre`** is written in Python using the Flask web framework.

The front end shows an html canvas where you are asked to draw a digit. **`Digitre`** recognizes the handwritten digit using Machine Learning (ML) and outputs its prediction.

The ML model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset using the [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/) software library (a high level abstraction of Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)).
